# ReactiveEnvironment

This is a simple interactive environment system that i have written using C++ and compute shader in Unreal Engine .At max 1 Compute will be executed per frame.
There is still a lot of noise in calculated Normals.
There is lots of room for improvements.

This is just a hobby project I created inspired by Unreal's Render to Material demo and Marvel Master's https://youtu.be/pX82z77TZc4 tried to replicate without that many draw calls and added snow,Mud,Grass interactions too.
